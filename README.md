# Audio-processing-Project
Audio Processing in Python
Audio waves are basically signals, and in this notebook, we discuss basic audio signal analysis on some audio files.
An audio signal can be categorized into following parts: (1) Speech : uttered by humans, which follow some language specific rules (2) Music : songs, instruments etc. (3) Others : bird sounds, animal sounds such as dog barking etc., (4) Vehicle, machinery sound etc.
In this notebook, we will learn following:

How to load an audio file?
How to obtain signal information?
How to play an audio file?
How to represent the signal in time domain?
How to visualize the signal characteristics in frequency domain?
Various libraries and alternatives exist for audio signal analysis in Python. In this notebook, we will see two ways for processing audio waves : (i) using SciPy (ii) using Librosa.
